Welcome to the ConSoSci/OpenFn integration docs site. Search or explore the
documentation for several projects aimed at improving the efficiency of wildlife
and wildlands conservation projects around the world.

## About
Conservation Social Science (ConSoSci) partnership is leveraging social science to strengthen conservation outcomes. 

This repo includes OpenFn-powered integration solutions for ConSoSci partners to connect data sources, including Kobo Toolbox, PostgreSQL and MySQL databases.

## Workstreams

- Project 1: BNS and NGRT Kobo survey integrations for centralized data management & analysis
- Project 2: Automated Kobo integration to autogenerate database tables & OpenFn jobs for data integration
- Project 3: Wildmeat Kobo surveys integration to track consumption data
- Project 4: KoboToolbox to Asana integration to track grievance data
- Project 5: Form Sharing Notifications, to notify the database administrator when new Kobo forms are shared with the aggregating account, so that they can be incuded in the integration workflow
