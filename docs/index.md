# ConSoSci Documentation

Welcome to the ConSoSci/OpenFn integration docs site. Search or explore the
documentation for several projects aimed at improving the efficiency of wildlife
and wildlands conservation projects around the world.

## About
Conservation Social Science (ConSoSci) partnership is leveraging social science to strengthen conservation outcomes. 

This repo includes OpenFn-powered integration solutions for ConSoSci partners to connect data sources, including Kobo Toolbox, PostgreSQL and MySQL databases.

## Workstreams

- Project 1: BNS and NGRT Kobo survey integrations for centralized data management & analysis
- Project 2: Automated Kobo integration to autogenerate database tables & OpenFn jobs for data integration
- Project 3: Wildmeat Kobo surveys integration to track consumption data

## OpenFn Projects

Relevant ConSoSci/WCS system administrators have access the following OpenFn.org projects for integration monitoring & management.

1. `WCS` --> source code hosted on `wcs` Github repo: [https://github.com/OpenFn/ConSoSci](https://github.com/OpenFn/ConSoSci)
2. `Wildmeat` --> source code hosted on `wcs-wildmeat` Github repo: [https://github.com/OpenFn/wcs-wildmeat](https://github.com/OpenFn/wcs-wildmeat)

## Training & Support
Contact [info@consosci.org](mailto://info@consosci.org), post on the [OpenFn Community](https://community.openfn.org/), or learn more on [OpenFn Docs](https://docs.openfn.org). 

OpenFn has conducted a series of training sessions for ConSoSci partners in April 2021, starting from an overview of the integration and the OpenFn platform, then covering integration design and concluding with more technical sessions on implementing OpenFn jobs.
