# WCS Grievances

## Project Overview & Prerequisites
The WCS Grievances project enables automated ingestion of GRM (Grievance Redress Mechanism) submissions from Kobo Toolbox, transforming and saving these into Asana for case management. This project was originally implemented in OpenFn V1 but has since been migrated to OpenFn V2 with several improvements to scalability and maintainability.

In the V2 version:
- Workflows have been modularized and split by region for better maintainability and clarity.
- A centralized workflow (`Get GRM Forms from Kobo`) is used to dynamically fetch configured forms and route submissions to the appropriate regional workflows based on the region mapping provided in the configuration spreadsheet.

### Prerequisites:
- Kobo credentials for form access
- A configuration spreadsheet containing form IDs and associated region codes
- Asana credentials and project setup per region
- Mapping documentation for each region-specific workflow

## Data Flows & Workflow Descriptions

### Overview
1. `Get GRM Forms from Kobo` fetches form metadata from the Google Sheet.
2. For each active form, it retrieves Kobo submissions from the past 7 days.
3. Submissions are enriched with metadata (e.g., region, project ID) and routed to the appropriate regional workflow.
4. The regional workflow processes and posts the data to Asana.

### Triggers & Scheduling

- The `Get GRM Forms from Kobo` workflow runs on a timer (cron) basis (every hour).
- Google Sheet configurations are read fresh on each execution, any changes to form routing or project IDs are picked up automatically.
- Regional workflows are triggered dynamically from the `Get GRM Forms from Kobo` workflow and are not independently scheduled.

### OpenFn Workflow Setup & Logic

#### 1. Get GRM Forms from Kobo Workflow
This workflow manages form discovery, Kobo data fetching, and submission routing.

Included Jobs:
- Get FormsList Ongoing: Reads form definitions, including formName, uid, region, and formId
- Get Kobo Forms Ongoing: 
  - Retrieves Kobo data using the uid. 
  - Rejects undefined or old cursors (>7 days)
  - Sends valid submissions to the right region workflow

#### 2. [Region] Sync to Asana Workflow
The WCS Grievances project is modularized into region-specific workflows. Each workflow corresponds to one of WCSâ€™s programmatic regions and contains the logic to process and post GRM form submissions from Kobo into the relevant Asana project.

Each regional workflow contains one or more OpenFn jobs:
- One job per Kobo form handled in that region
- Jobs are responsible for:
  - Cleaning and validating incoming Kobo submissions
  - Mapping form fields to Asana custom fields and enum options
  - Posting the data as a task in a specified Asana project using upsertTask

**Regional Workflows Summary**
Below is a list of all regional workflows and their corresponding responsibilities:

| Region                                   | Workflow Name on OpenFn |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| East Africa Western Indian Ocean & Madagascar | `EAWIO Sync to Asana`        |
| Global                                   | `Global Sync to Asana`       |
| Greater Mekong                           | `Greater Mekong Sync to Asana`          |
| Andes, Amazon & Orinoco                  | `AAO Sync to Asana`          |
| Central Africa & Gulf of Guinea          | `CAGG Sync to Asana`          |
| Mesoamerica & Western Caribbean          | `MesoAmerica Sync to Asana`          |
| Patagonia                                | `Patagonia Sync to Asana`          |
| Southeast Asia Pacific                   | `SAP 1. Sync to Asana` and `SAP 2. Update Asana Task Aceh`          |
| Sudano-Sahel                             | `Sudano Sahel Sync to Asana`          |

For scalability, WCS also required that this integration be designed such that multiple versions of the Kobo form (with identical fields) can be mapped to their own corresponding project tasks in Asana. 

There are two types of fields to be mapped:

i. Open-Ended Kobo Fields: These fields are NOT drop-down fields. They are typically Date fields or fields that accept free text input from the user. The key-value pair statements needed to populate the custom fields are auto-generated in Job #1. These ones are mapped as follows: 

       custom_fields: {'1234567890123456': dataValue('body.OneDriveFolder')} 

ii. Multiple Choice / Drop-down Kobo fields. These fields typically have a list of pre-defined choices that users must select from. In Asana, these are mapped to `enum_options` which also have their unique gid values for every single choice in kobo. The key-value pair statements needed to populate the custom fields are also auto-generated in Job #1. These parameters are structured as follows:

       custom_fields: {
          1234567890123456: state =>
          state.formatMapping[dataValue('body.GrievanceOrSuggestion')(state)],
       }  

For the Task name in Asana, we used a combination of (1) the GrievanceID (filled in by the survey respondent) and (2) the unique, auto-generated KoboToolbox ID ( `_id` ). This was assigned to the `name` key in the `upsert()` method as follows:

       name: state =>
         `${dataValue('body.GrievanceID')(state)} (KoboID:${dataValue('body._id')(state)})`, 

The `externalId : "name",` key-value pair was included as well, to create a unique reference between a task in Asana and another database, such as cross-referencing an Asana task with a customer record in a CRM.

Next, a `formatMapping` method was included in the First Job, to map every single Kobo queston field and answer choice (obtained from Kobo `state.data` ) to a corresponding gid in Asana. For example, The *Country* field and its answer options were each mapped to gids as follows:

   
    Country: '1200158353214078',
    Afghanistan: '1187466717116802',
    Argentina: '1187466717116803',
    Bangladesh: '1187466717116804', 
   

Upsert the data into the Asana project, as follows:

       upsertTask(
          dataValue('projectid'),...
       );

> âš  *Notes for developers:*
> - An example of this `Upsert Job`  is linked to the Github file [`/asana/upsertTask.js`](https://github.com/OpenFn/ConSoSci/blob/master/asana/upsertTask.js).
> - On OpenFn.org this job is configured with the `asana` adaptor, and a `message filter` trigger which is activated every time a Kobo form is fetched with a matching name (e.g., `{"formName":"WCS Global Grievances"}`). 

#### 3. 0. Get Asana Field IDs for Project Workflow
 
Written to retrieve the gids of all the associated fields from the Asana project. **Note**: the Project gid is found in the Asana project URL, which usually has the format:`https://app.asana.com/0/<Project_gid/list`. 

The key is to create a dummy task in Asana using the " +Add task" button in the Asana UI. Click to view the Asana task details and take note of the UI structure in the browser. It should look like this:. 

`https://app.asana.com/0/<Project_gid>/< Task_gid>`
(**Note**: We use the TaskID in the getTask request, and not the _ProjectID_)

This *Task_gid* becomes an argument in a `getTask` request sent to Asana. The output of `state.data` contains the gids for all the Asana fields, otions and labels. Finally, this job is then modified to  create a mapping table of Kobo field response choices to their respective Asana custom_fields_choices gids. It also generates and logs a set of statements that can be inserted into Fn blocks in the main upsert job (Job #2).

This job is run *only once* as the Asana field gids for a given project are unique and doo not change. Thus this job can be switched off or archived afterwards.

### Special Flow: Indonesia (Aceh)

The `SAP 1. Sync to Asana` and `SAP 2. Update Asana Task Aceh` workflows support a customized workflow for the Indonesia (Aceh) region. In addition to syncing Kobo submissions to Asana, this region also syncs submissions to a protected GoogleSheet used for ongoing updates by the WCS Indonesia team.

#### 1. SAP 1. Sync to Asana

After a Kobo submission is upserted as a task in Asana via the `SAP 1. Sync to Asana` job, the data is also written to a designated GoogleSheet. This secondary sync:

- Cleans, maps, and loads the Kobo data into the sheet.
- Stores the `Asana Task ID` as the unique identifier for each row.
- Enables a one-to-one mapping between Kobo and sheet records:

      1 Kobo submission => 1 row in GoogleSheets

- Includes protected ranges to prevent deletion or editing of sensitive fields. Only specific users (WCS Indonesia and the document owner) can edit rows or trigger changes.

ðŸ“˜ Refer to the [GRM GoogleSheets User Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vAPLG1Sc4pSe6L0z3J5qVfmQFcvuJ1zEGmEKuExs5iI/edit) for more on sheet permissions and usage.

#### 2. SAP 2. Update Asana Task Aceh

The `SAP 2. Update Asana Task Aceh` workflow is triggered when changes are made in the GoogleSheet.

- A **Google Apps Script** runs daily at midnight UTC and sends updated rows to OpenFn.
- Alternatively, users can manually trigger the sync by clicking the **"OpenFn Sync"** button in the sheet.
- The job:
  - Locates the corresponding task in Asana using the stored `Asana Task ID`
  - Maps and loads updated field values from the sheet
  - Only syncs fields listed in the `MAP 2: GoogleSheets â†’ Asana` tab in the [mapping specs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D3_smWDjelubR_Lg-1xex9TLl6lAEGMSbGDyw8whqx4/edit#gid=373544466)

ðŸ“˜ See the [GRM GoogleSheets User Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vAPLG1Sc4pSe6L0z3J5qVfmQFcvuJ1zEGmEKuExs5iI/edit) for more information about editable fields and triggering syncs.

This hybrid workflow enables both task creation in Asana and spreadsheet-based case management by local teams. OpenFn ensures that updates made in the GoogleSheet are reflected in Asana, keeping the two systems synchronized for consistent case tracking and follow-up.

### Assumptions

1. The jobs and mapping design are based on this [KoboToolBox to Asana Integration Requirement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1blAjAyZ1UfDI-3zDdf38sXYqevroGQVHxOkFWseNTS4/edit#) of WCS.
2. All data cleaning will be done in Kobo Toolbox. Every time Kobo data is
   received, OpenFn first checks for a matching task record in Asana, If a match is found, the Task is updated with new details. If a matching task is not found, a new Task is created in Asana with the data fields populated.
3. The uuid used for syncing with the destination DB is the Kobo answer `_id`. The combination of `GrievanceID` and Kobo `_id_` creates a unique identifier for each form across various systems that would interact wit this data. **Note:** `uuid` may vary, and hence not a reliable unique identifier.
4. Only the GoogleSheets document owner and the WCS GoogleSheets integration user will be able to update the protected ranges in the GoogleSheet or delete rows in the Sheet. 
5. The `Update Asana Task` should always find the Asana task using the uuid `Asana Task Id`. If the task is not found in Asana it may have been deleted in Asana or someone may have changed the ID in the GoogleSheet. If assumption number 1 is met, only the WCS user and the document owner would have the privileges to update the ID the GoogleSheet.
6. Because Asana tasks can be moved to different projects, Asana users should make sure OpenFn has access to those project spaces so that the integration will always find the task to be updated.
7. The GoogleSheet sharing setting will remain set to "Restricted - Only people with access can open with the link" so that any changes made to the document will be associated with a user.
