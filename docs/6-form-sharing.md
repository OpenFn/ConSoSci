# Kobo Form Sharing Notification for WCS Admins

Lists of "deployed" and "archived" Kobo BNS/NRGT forms for data collection are stored in [this Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s7K3kxzm5AlpwiALattyc7D9_aIyqWmo2ubcQIUlqlY/edit?gid=1559623602#gid=1559623602). 

The below "Form Sharing" workflows have been configured in OpenFn. See the [form-sharing](https://github.com/OpenFn/ConSoSci/tree/master/form-sharing) directory for the underlying code. 

ðŸŽ¥ **[See this video](https://www.loom.com/share/4dbaa205e60c45d3be17fdde1dcc64a6?sid=b4c3e321-e1ed-4250-9367-d67e101bb543)** for an overview of how the solution works, and the below sections on how to manage the forms list in the Google Sheet. 

When the workflow runs, it will: 
1. Check the connected Kobo accounts for form updates
2. Compare any updated forms with the list of deployed forms in the ["Deployed" Forms Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s7K3kxzm5AlpwiALattyc7D9_aIyqWmo2ubcQIUlqlY/edit?gid=1559623602#gid=1559623602)
3. Add any newly deployed forms to the Sheet
4. Update rows in the ["Deployed" Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s7K3kxzm5AlpwiALattyc7D9_aIyqWmo2ubcQIUlqlY/edit?gid=1559623602#gid=1559623602) if forms are archived, and then add the archived form to the ["Archived" Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s7K3kxzm5AlpwiALattyc7D9_aIyqWmo2ubcQIUlqlY/edit?gid=1965562058#gid=1965562058)
5. Assign Asana Task(s) to the WCS admin to review every form newly deployed or archived

## Managing the Forms Lists in Google Sheets
[This Master Forms Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s7K3kxzm5AlpwiALattyc7D9_aIyqWmo2ubcQIUlqlY/edit?gid=1559623602#gid=1559623602) is now the source of truth for what Kobo forms should or should not be synced to the ConSoSci database. Update the column `automate_sync` to true/false to specify whether these forms should be included when either the [BNS-1A Ongoing]() or [BNS-1B Historical] "Get forms" jobs run.

## Syncing BNS/NRGT Kobo Form Submissions
Now with this [Master Forms Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s7K3kxzm5AlpwiALattyc7D9_aIyqWmo2ubcQIUlqlY/edit?gid=1559623602#gid=1559623602) set up, there are 3 workflows configured to sync BNS and NRGT forms on an ongoing and historical basis in the `ConSoSci` project. 

ðŸŽ¥ **[See this video](https://www.loom.com/share/1cf1021e73f945e8a13e792df8d3afe3?sid=29269619-3b3f-485f-998b-3c65aeb03bff) for how to manage ongoing and historical syncing of Kobo forms.**

1. **Ongoing sync**: The `[BNS1-A]` jobs will sync "deployed" Kobo forms (where `automate_sync: true` in the [deployed forms sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s7K3kxzm5AlpwiALattyc7D9_aIyqWmo2ubcQIUlqlY/edit?gid=1559623602#gid=1559623602)). 

![bns-1a](./bns-1-ongoing.png)

2. **Historical sync**: The `[BNS1-B]` jobs will sync "archived" Kobo forms (where `automate_sync: true` in the [archived forms sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s7K3kxzm5AlpwiALattyc7D9_aIyqWmo2ubcQIUlqlY/edit?gid=1965562058#gid=1965562058)). 

![bns-1b](./bns-2-historical.png)

3. **On-demand sync**: The `[BNS3]` job will sync all submissions for _any_ Kobo form manually entered into this job. (This is in case you want to run syncs on-demand, but do not want to update the forms lists in the Google Sheet.)

## Syncing Kobo metadata for GRM forms

An additional workflow has been set up to fetch deployed GRM form data from the [Master Forms Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s7K3kxzm5AlpwiALattyc7D9_aIyqWmo2ubcQIUlqlY/edit?gid=1559623602#gid=1559623602), get metadata (submission count, last submission date) from Kobo for those forms, and then update the WCS Programs Database KoboData table with the metadata.

## Specifications
- Original [Github technical specification](https://github.com/OpenFn/ConSoSci/issues/206) and the [workflow diagram (v2)](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/346b8e5c-6fb6-4a33-9d02-53e5059bd698/edit?invitationId=inv_d1431bce-05ae-4005-9b6a-9c279141a3a3&page=0_0#)
- [Change request](https://github.com/OpenFn/ConSoSci/issues/224) for how archived forms are managed 

## How to re-process Kobo form submissions & re-sync historical data
You can either: 
1. add the form to the [archived forms list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s7K3kxzm5AlpwiALattyc7D9_aIyqWmo2ubcQIUlqlY/edit?gid=1965562058#gid=1965562058), set the column L `automate-sync: true` and run the historical job to re-sync _all_ submissions for that form, or 
2. specify a manual cursor in the [Get FormsList Ongoing job](https://v1.openfn.org/projects/consosci/jobs/E7cauG).
